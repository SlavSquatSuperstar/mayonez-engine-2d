Changing User Preferences

2. Any changes to "preferences.json" will be applied upon restart.
3. Removing a line will cause the program to load the defaults for that setting.

Log Files
1. Log files are automatically generated if the preference "save_logs" is set to true.
2. Logs record application events used to debug the game if something goes wrong.
3. Players may safely delete log files if no errors occur while running the program.
