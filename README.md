## Features

This fully-operational game engine includes:

- A physics system with force-based movement, multiple collider shapes, linear and angular impulse resolution, and
  friction
- A 2D renderer that can draw sprites and shapes with both Java AWT and LWJGL OpenGL libraries
- An entity-component system that allows you to create modular, reusable game objects and components
- An asset system that can read from classpath resources and read and write to local files
- Keyboard and mouse input that supports key presses, mouse clicks and movement, and key axes
- Scene management that allows you to load multiple scenes and save their states when switching
- Logging with different message priorities and automatic log file generation
- Debug rendering capabilities for drawing and filling shapes, lines, and points
- Customizable game preferences that you can set yourself

### Planned

- A UI system with reusable components such as buttons and labels
- An event system for keyboard and mouse inputs
- Font rendering for displaying text on UI
- Nestable game objects that will be fixed to the parent object's position
- And much more to come later!

## Quick Start Guide

### System Requirements

- 64-bit operating system
- Graphics card supporting OpenGL 3.3
- Java 17 (see further instructions)

### Instructions for Players

- Download the latest Java version: [Eclipse Temurin 17+](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases) (select "JRE" under "
  Package Type") or [Oracle JRE 17+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- Extract and run the installer, then check if Java is installed by entering `java --version` inside a command
  line/terminal window.
- Download the repository, drag `run` (Mac/Linux) or `run.bat` (Windows) from the extracted folder into your command
  line/terminal, and press enter.

### Instructions for Developers

To download this repository, run `git clone https://github.com/SlavSquatSuperstar/mayonez-engine-2d.git`.
Then, in an IDE, create a new project from existing sources and import a Gradle project.
You can also create a new project from version control using the link above if your editor supports it.
There are several Gradle tasks (compile, test, run, export) included to help in your development.

Below are the tools and libraries used in the development of this project.

- Java Version: [Eclipse Temurin 17+](https://adoptium.net/)
  or [Oracle OpenJDK 17+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
- Kotlin Version: [1.8+](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew1820.html)
- Recommended IDE: [Intellij IDEA CE 2023.1+](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- Build System: [Gradle 8.1+](https://gradle.org/install/)
    - Utilizes [Gradle Shadow Plugin](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow/releases) for creating fat jars

- Dependencies (bundled in JAR)
    - [LWJGL 3.3.1](https://www.lwjgl.org/customize) (user OS & architecture specific)
        - Libraries: [JOML](https://joml-ci.github.io/JOML/), GLFW, OpenGL, and STB
    - [Kotlin Standard Library](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html)
    - [JSON in Java](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) (org.json)
    - [Java Reflections](https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections) (org.reflections)
    - [SLF4J Simple Binding](https://www.slf4j.org/) (dependency for Reflections)
    - [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) (not bundled, for testing only)
