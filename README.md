# Mayonez Engine

The 2D Java game engine to fit your Slavic needs!*â€ 

This project was developed using macOS 13.x Ventura (Intel) and Intellij IDEA. This progam has not been tested on any
other systems.

## Features

This fully-operational game engine includes:

- A physics system with dynamic movement, multiple collider shapes, linear and angular impulse resolution, and friction
- A 2D renderer that can draw sprites with both Java AWT and LWJGL OpenGL libraries
- An entity-component system that allows you to create modular, reusable game objects and components
- An asset system that can read from classpath resources and read and write to local files
- Keyboard and mouse input that supports key presses, mouse clicks and movement, and key axes
- Scene management that allows you to load multiple scenes and save their states when switching
- Logging with different message priorities and automatic log file generation
- Debug rendering capabilities for drawing and filling shapes, lines, and points
- Customizable game preferences that you can set yourself

## Quick Start Guide
